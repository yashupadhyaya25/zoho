**1. Timesheet Conversion:**
    Convert Zoho timesheets into a predefined format that meets the specific requirements of the organization.
    Ensure the converted timesheets are accurate, consistent, and compatible with the organization's reporting systems.

**2. Shadow Resource Management:**
    Implement a system to allocate shadow resources when primary resources (onboard resources) are on leave.
    Ensure that shadow resources can seamlessly take over tasks without disrupting project timelines.
    Maintain proper documentation and comments in the timesheet to reflect the allocation of shadow resources.
